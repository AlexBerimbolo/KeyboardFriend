# KeyboardFriend
Help remember and organize your keybinds with Keyboard Friend!
A virtual keyboard where you can see your keybinds, and how they are mapped.
it gives a nice display of your keybinds.
I made it because I wanted to easily map my i3 keybinds and vim keybinds so that they are not overlapping.

Currently in alpha release. Highlighting and tooltips work if you upload your i3 config file
